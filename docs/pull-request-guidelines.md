## Pull request guidelines

- When providing a pull request, the pull request must target the `dev` branch of the repository. Pull requests that target the `main` branch of the repository are asked to be updated to point to the correct branch.
- When writing a pull request, ensure your work does not introduce new errors or warnings.
- When writing a pull request, ensure your work does not introduce breaking changes to older versions or map packs, unless otherwise fixable in another way or regarding a deprecated feature.
- When discussing a pull request we ask you to accept the changes team members request of you.

### Pull request flow
The pull request flow differs between general users and team members. In order for the flow to remain quick and easy to work with team members can choose to not follow required steps that must be taken by general users.
